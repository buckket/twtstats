twtstats
~~~~~~~~

I accidentally stumbled upon twint[0] and wanted to make use of the
data that piled up on my hard drive. While at first I was pleased
with simply calculating a few statistical values of interest,
I soon figured it would be nicer to generate some kind of graph,
which could visualize the relationships between me and others much
better than plain old numbers and sorted lists.

Such tools already exist of course, but usually this are web-based
services which require OAUTH access, are not transparent about how
they generate the graphs and only use a handful of tweets to
extract the necessary information.

Thanks to pandas[1] and graphviz[2] the hardest part is already
being taken care of. The only thing left to do is downloading
the required data set and counting the interaction that took place
between all users of interest. I figured the best way to start is to
take the 10 most mentioned users and also grab their tweets to see
if the interaction is mutual or one-sided. On top of that we also
include their most mentioned users as well to see if our network
interacts with users we ourself don’t. Those edges are highlighted
by using a dashed line. Additionally the penwith scales
logarithmically with the weight, which in turn is the sum of every
interaction that took place between two users. sfdp(1) then
generates this rather nice looking graphs in seconds.

This is just an experiment because I was interested in graph
generation and visualisation. I don’t really know what I’m doing.
Definitely not a data science / statistics guru (just yet).

If you have suggestions on how improve this or if you have
spotted a fundamental mistake feel free to contact me.
